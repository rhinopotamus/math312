Course materials and resources for MATH 312 Abstract Algebra.


## Structure

The `latex` folder contains all the LaTeX source code that I used to generate homeworks, slides, and other course documents. (Note, however, that I've configured my LaTeX engine to produce all its output into the `pdf` folder.)

The `resources` folder contains things like textbook recommendations, websites, videos, etc.

## Contributing
