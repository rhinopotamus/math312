Here are proofs for each of the parts of the challenge problems that are proof-based. I have written them to purposefully be a bit annoying; your job is to use the data-claim-warrant structure to validate the proofs, and also to say what is annoying about them.

At least one of these proofs has a subtle error in it (that I originally made by honest accident but then decided to leave in for pedagogical purposes). Can you find it?

\begin{problem} Here we shall track down the details from our discussion of the mystery group of order 16 from class on Wednesday.
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Let $g\in G$ and suppose that $\<g\>$ is a normal subgroup of order 2. Prove that $g\in Z(G)$.
        \begin{proof}
            Let $x\in G$. $x\<g\>x\inv = \<g\>$, so either $xgx\inv = e$, in which case $xg = x$, so $g = 1$, which certainly isn't true, or else $xgx\inv = g$. Then $xg = gx$, so $g \in Z(G)$.

            Claims:
            \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
                \item $x\<g\>x\inv = \<g\>$
                \item either $xgx\inv = e$ or $xgx\inv = g$
                \item (Case 1: $xgx\inv = e$) $xg = x$
                \item $g=1$
                \item which certainly isn't true
                \item (Case 2: $xgx\inv=g$) $xg = gx$
                \item $g\in Z(G)$
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{proof}
        \item Suppose that $G$ is generated by two generators, say $G = \<g, h \mid \ldots \>$. Prove that if $g\in Z(G)$, then $h\in Z(G)$.
        \begin{proof}
            A generic element of $G$ looks like $s_1^{p_1} s_2^{p_2} \ldots s_k^{p_k}$, where $p_i \in \Z$ and each $s_i$ is either $g$ or $h$. Therefore, it's enough to show that $h\cdot g^p = g^p \cdot h$. But since $g\in Z(G)$, $hg = gh$, so $hg^p = g^ph$. Therefore, $h\in Z(G)$.

            Claims:
            \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
                \item A generic element of $G$ looks like...
                \item It's enough to show that...
                \item $hg = gh$
                \item $hg^p = g^ph$
                \item $h\in Z(G)$
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{proof}
        \item Let $G$ be a finitely generated group, say $G = \<g_1, \ldots, g_n \mid \ldots\>$. (Note that $G$ doesn't have to be finite -- the integers, for example, are finitely generated.) Prove that if all the generators $g_i \in Z(G)$, then $G$ is abelian.
        \begin{proof}
            A generic element of $G$ looks like $s_1^{p_1} s_2^{p_2} \ldots s_k^{p_k}$, where $p_i \in \Z$ and each $s_i$ is one of the generators $g_i$. Therefore, it's enough to show for generic generators $g_i$ and $g_j$ that $g_i \cdot g_j^p = g_j^p \cdot g_i$. Since $g_i \in Z(G)$, $g_i g_j = g_j g_i$. Therefore, $g_i g_j^p = g_j^p g_i$, so $G$ is abelian.

            Claims:
            \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
                \item A generic element of $G$ looks like...
                \item It's enough to show ...
                \item $g_i g_j = g_j g_i$. 
                \item $g_i g_j^p = g_j^p g_i$
                \item $G$ is abelian.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{proof}
        \item Now, getting more specific: in the mystery group, we knew that $s^2 = r^8 = 1$. How did we know those two things?

        \begin{proof}
            (Well, not really a proof, more of just an observation.) \\
            By looking at the lattice, $|\<s\>| = 2$ and $|\<r\>| = 8$.
        \end{proof}
        \item Suppose that $\<s\>$ and $\<r^4s\>$ \textit{aren't} normal; therefore they must be conjugate. Prove that $srs = r^5$. (Hint: conjugate by $r$.)

        \begin{proof}
            First, note that $r\not\in \<r^4s\>$. Therefore, $r\<r^4s\>r\inv = \<s\>$. Either $r(r^4s)r\inv = s$, in which case $r^5s = sr$ so $r^5 = srs$, or $r(r^4s)r\inv = 1$, in which case $r^5s = r$, so $s = r^4$. But $s$ certainly doesn't equal $r^4$, so $srs = r^5$.

            Claims:
            \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
                \item $r\not\in \<r^4s\>$
                \item $r\<r^4s\>r\inv = \<s\>$
                \item Either $r(r^4s)r\inv = s$ or $r(r^4s)r\inv = 1$
                \item (Case 1: $r(r^4s)r\inv = s$)  $r^5s = sr$ 
                \item $r^5 = srs$
                \item (Case 2: $r(r^4s)r\inv = 1$) $r^5s = r$
                \item $s = r^4$. 
                \item $s$ certainly doesn't equal $r^4$
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
    Write down a full proof of Lagrange's theorem: 
    
    \begin{center}
        if $H\leq G$, then $|H|$ divides $|G|$, and further, $|G| = [G:H]\cdot |H|$.
    \end{center}
    
    (This just entails stringing together the arguments we made on the slides before the Lagrange's theorem slide, but I think it's moderately nice to see it all written out.)

    \begin{proof}
        It's nice to split this proof up into three little lemmas:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item First, note that for any $g\in G$, $|gH| = |H|$. To prove this, consider the function $\phi:gH \to H$ defined by $\phi(gh) = h$. This function is injective (aka 1-1): if $gh_1 = gh_2$, then $h_1 = h_2$, so $\phi(gh_1) = \phi(gh_2)$. This function is also surjective (aka onto): if $h\in H$, then $\phi(gh) = h$. Therefore, this function is a bijection, so $|gH| = |H|$.
            \item Next, note that distinct cosets are disjoint. For suppose $g\in g_1H$ and $g\in g_2H$. Then there exist $h_1, h_2\in H$ such that $g_1h_1 = g = g_2h_2$. Therefore, $g_1 = g_2(h_2 h_1\inv)$, so $g_1H = g_2H$.
            \item Finally, note that the cosets cover all of $G$, because if $g\in G$, then $g\in gH$.
        \end{itemize}
        So: if $|H| = m$ and $[G:H]=n$, then $G$ is made up of $n$ sets of $m$ elements, so $|G| = mn$.
    \end{proof}
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
    Prove that $|\operatorname{cl}_G(H)| = [G:N_G(H)]$.
    \begin{proof}
        (Signposts: The human-words translation of this sentence is that the number of subgroups conjugate to $H$ is the same as the number of cosets of $N_G(H)$. Indeed, any element that makes a nontrivial conjugate of $H$ is precisely \textit{not} in the normalizer, so it'll make a nontrivial coset of the normalizer.) 
        
        Because I am already annoyed at typing $N_G(H)$ repeatedly, let's just call it $N$. Let's establish a bijection between cosets of $N$ and conjugate subgroups of $H$; specifically, let's map $xN$ to $xHx\inv$. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This map is clearly surjective.
            \item This map is injective: if $xHx\inv = yHy\inv$, then $(y\inv x) H (y\inv x)\inv = H$, so $y\inv x \in N$. This means that the coset $y\inv x N$ is the identity coset $N$. Therefore, $yN = y\left(y\inv xN\right) = xN$.
            \item (A secret third thing should be here. Do you know what it is?)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{proof}
\end{problem}

\end{document}
