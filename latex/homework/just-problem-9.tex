\begin{problem*}\label{A4-cosets}
    Here's an extended problem where you can explore the relationship between left cosets, right cosets, conjugate subgroups, and normalizers.

    Below are three Cayley diagrams of $A_4$, each highlighting the left cosets of a different subgroup. These are the subgroups $N$, $H$, and $K$ from slide 17 of the normal-subgroups slides from class on Wednesday. To make the notation suck less and the Cayley diagrams more readable, we can take $\Alert{a=(123)}$, $\Palert{b=(134)}$, $\Balert{x=(12)(34)}$, and $\Galert{z=(13)(24)}$; arrows in the Cayley diagrams are color-coded appropriately. Then:
    \[N = \<\Balert{x}, \Galert{z}\>; \qquad H = \<\Alert{a}\>; \qquad K = \<\Balert{x}\>.\]

        \item Label each of the ``coset bubbles'' in each diagram above with which left coset it is. For instance, $\{a, c, b, d\}$ is certainly $aN$.
        \item For each subgroup shown above, partition $A_4$ into its right
        cosets. (Work smarter not harder: think about which elements you actually need to bother shifting by!)
        Write the right cosets as subsets of $A_4$, consisting of permutations
        in cycle notation. Also, highlight them by colors on a fresh copy
        of the Cayley diagrams -- see the next page.
        \item Conjecture as to why I made some of the bubbles blue and some of them red. Relatedly, find $N_{A_4}(N)$, $N_{A_4}(H)$, and $N_{A_4}(K)$.
        \item For each (non-identity) left coset $gH$, illustrate the construction of the
        conjugate subgroup $gHg^{-1}$ on a fresh copy of the Cayley
        diagram -- see next page. Repeat this for $N$ and $K$. \\
