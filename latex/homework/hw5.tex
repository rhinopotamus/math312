HW due Sunday 2/23 by pdf upload to Canvas; .tex source on the \href{https://github.com/rhinopotamus/math312}{MATH 312 github repo}.

In all the following, let $H$ be a generic subgroup of a generic group $G$; that is, let $H \leq G$.

%%======================================================================
\subsection*{Stuff from class slides that I promised would be on the homework}

\begin{problem}
    Prove that $N_G(H) \leq G$. (Here and elsewhere, hooray for the one-step subgroup test.)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} A problem in two parts:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Prove that $H \leq N_G(H)$.
        \item Prove that $H\normaleq N_G(H)$. (Careful: you only have to coset by stuff in $N_G(H)$, not stuff in the wider universe of $G$.)
    \end{enumerate} 
\end{problem}

\begin{remark}
    By stapling together the results of Problem 1 and Problem 2, we get a useful corollary: $N_G(H)$ has to be somewhere between $H$ and $G$ (inclusive) in the subgroup lattice of $G$.
\end{remark} 

\begin{problem}
    Prove that if $ghg\inv \in H$ for all $h\in H$ and $g\in G$, then $gHg\inv = H$ for all $g\in G$.

    Hint: Our favorite tool for proving that two sets $A$ and $B$ are equal is to show that $A \subseteq B$ and also that $A \supseteq B$. For $\subseteq$: Let $a\in A$. Blah blah blah, therefore $a\in B$. For $\supseteq$: vice versa. \\ (Our second favorite tool is to establish a bijection between $A$ and $B$.)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Let $g\in G$. Prove that $gHg\inv \leq G$, and thus that $gHg\inv$ deserves to be called a ``conjugate \Balert{subgroup}.''
\end{problem}

%%======================================================================
\subsection*{Immediate corollaries of Lagrange's theorem}

\begin{problem}
    Show that if $G$ is a finite group and $x\in G$, then the order of $x$ divides the order of $G$. (Moral: it is reasonable for us to use the same word ``order'' for these two ideas.)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Show that if $|G| = p$ a prime, then $G$ is cyclic.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Show that if $[G:H] = p$ a prime, then either $N_G(H) = H$ or $H \normal G$. \\(Hint: use the tower law.)
\end{problem}

\vfill

Hint: All the problems on this page can be resolved in like two or three lines.

\subsection*{Exploring cosets}

\begin{problem}\label{4Z}
    So far we have been looking exclusively at cosets in groups written multiplicatively, where they look like $gH = \{g\cdot h \mid h\in H\}$. Let's look at cosets in $(\Z, +)$, where we shift by \textit{adding} instead of by \textit{multiplying}.
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Consider the subgroup $4\Z = \{\ldots -4, 0, 4, 8, \ldots\} = \<4\>$. Find all of its cosets. \\
        (Hint: you will be unsurprised about how many of them there are.)
        \item What is $[\Z:4\Z]$? (Hint: the answer is unsurprising and also it is not $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$.)
        \item Suppose that $p > 2$ is a prime number. (2 is an annoying exception to \textit{many} theorems about prime numbers.) Which cosets is it possible for $p$ to live in?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{A4-cosets}
    Here's an extended problem where you can explore the relationship between left cosets, right cosets, conjugate subgroups, and normalizers.

    Below are three Cayley diagrams of $A_4$, each highlighting the left cosets of a different subgroup. These are the subgroups $N$, $H$, and $K$ from slide 17 of the normal-subgroups slides from class on Wednesday. To make the notation suck less and the Cayley diagrams more readable, we can take $\Alert{a=(123)}$, $\Palert{b=(134)}$, $\Balert{x=(12)(34)}$, and $\Galert{z=(13)(24)}$; arrows in the Cayley diagrams are color-coded appropriately. Then:
    \[N = \<\Balert{x}, \Galert{z}\>; \qquad H = \<\Alert{a}\>; \qquad K = \<\Balert{x}\>.\]

        \item Label each of the ``coset bubbles'' in each diagram above with which left coset it is. For instance, $\{a, c, b, d\}$ is certainly $aN$.
        \item For each subgroup shown above, partition $A_4$ into its right
        cosets. (Work smarter not harder: think about which elements you actually need to bother shifting by!)
        Write the right cosets as subsets of $A_4$, consisting of permutations
        in cycle notation. Also, highlight them by colors on a fresh copy
        of the Cayley diagrams -- see the next page.
        \item Conjecture as to why I made some of the bubbles blue and some of them red. Relatedly, find $N_{A_4}(N)$, $N_{A_4}(H)$, and $N_{A_4}(K)$.
        \item For each (non-identity) left coset $gH$, illustrate the construction of the
        conjugate subgroup $gHg^{-1}$ on a fresh copy of the Cayley
        diagram -- see next page. Repeat this for $N$ and $K$. \\

\begin{problem}
    The subgroup lattice of some weird group called $C_4\rtimes C_4$ is shown below. This is a ``semidirect product'' -- it is kinda like a direct product but the copies of $C_4$ that went in the inflated nodes of $C_4$ are ``rewired.'' All you need to know about it is that, like the direct product, elements are ordered pairs, so $|C_4 \rtimes C_4| = 16$.

\subsection*{Challenges}

All problems in this section are optional.

\newtheorem*{oq}{Open question}
\begin{oq}
    Can you make / find a group that has an \textit{interesting} subgroup lattice in which every subgroup is a unicorn? (It is easy to do this in a \textit{boring} way: for instance, consider the subgroup lattice of $C_6$.)
\end{oq}

\begin{problem} Here we shall track down the details from our discussion of the mystery group of order 16 from class on Wednesday.
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Let $g\in G$ and suppose that $\<g\>$ is a normal subgroup of order 2. Prove that $g\in Z(G)$.
        \item Suppose that $G$ is generated by two generators, say $G = \<g, h \mid \ldots \>$. Prove that if $g\in Z(G)$, then $h\in Z(G)$.
        \item Let $G$ be a finitely generated group, say $G = \<g_1, \ldots, g_n \mid \ldots\>$. (Note that $G$ doesn't have to be finite -- the integers, for example, are finitely generated.) Prove that if all the generators $g_i \in Z(G)$, then $G$ is abelian.
        \item Now, getting more specific: in the mystery group, we knew that $s^2 = r^8 = 1$. How did we know those two things?
        \item Suppose that $\<s\>$ and $\<r^4s\>$ \textit{aren't} normal; therefore they must be conjugate. Prove that $srs = r^5$. (Hint: conjugate by $r$.)
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Screw around with the LMFDB database of abstract groups linked on Canvas. Find something fun / interesting and tell me about it.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Write down a full proof of Lagrange's theorem: 
    
    \begin{center}
        if $H\leq G$, then $|H|$ divides $|G|$, and further, $|G| = [G:H]\cdot |H|$.
    \end{center}
    
    (This just entails stringing together the arguments we made on the slides before the Lagrange's theorem slide, but I think it's moderately nice to see it all written out.)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    State the converse of (the first sentence of) Lagrange's theorem. Prove it or find a counterexample. 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Repeat Problem \ref{4Z}, but for the subgroup $6\Z$, and increase $p$ to be $p > 3$. 
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
    Repeat again but for $8\Z$, and tell me what the correct lower bound on $p$ is.
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
    Prove that $|\operatorname{cl}_G(H)| = [G:N_G(H)]$. \\
    (This is easier than you think; translate this sentence into human words and you are like 71\% there.)
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}
    Come up with a reasonable definition for how to quantify ``how normal'' slash ``how unnormal'' a subgroup is. For instance, in Problem \ref{A4-cosets}, $N$ should be yes 100\% normal, $K$ should be moderately un-normal, and $H$ should be as un-normal as possible.
\end{problem}
