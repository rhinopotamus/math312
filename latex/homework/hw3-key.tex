\subsection*{Stuff about permutation groups and $S_n$}

\begin{problem} (Omitted from key bc any reasonable explanation is correct.)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Suppose that $g, h \in G$. We mentioned in class that the \textit{conjugate} of $h$ by $g$ is the element $ghg\inv$. The \textit{conjugacy class} of $h$ is the set of all the possible conjugates of $h$: $\{ghg\inv \mid g\in G\}.$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Find the conjugacy classes of all six elements of $S_3$. (If you use the permutation calculator, make sure you're multiplying left-to-right!) 
        \begin{red}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Identity: $\{e\}$
                \item Transpositions: $\{(1\;2), (1\;3), (2\;3)\}$
                \item 3-cycles: $\{(1\;2\;3), (1\;3\;2)\}$
            \end{itemize}
        \end{red}
        \item If you are having fun, find the conjugacy classes of all 24 elements of $S_4$.
        \begin{red}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Identity: $\{e\}$
                \item Transpositions: $\{(1\;2), (1\;3), (1\;4), (2\;3), (2\;4), (3\;4)\}$
                \item Double transpositions: $\{(1\;2)(3\;4), (1\;3)(2\;4), (1\;4)(2\;3)\}$
                \item 3-cycles: $\{(1\;2\;3), (1\;3\;2), (1\;2\;4), (1\;4\;2),
                (1\;3\;4),(1\;4\;3),(2\;3\;4),(2\;4\;3)\}$
                \item 4-cycles: $\{(1\;2\;3\;4), (1\;2\;4\;3), (1\;3\;2\;4), (1\;3\;4\;2), (1\;4\;2\;3), (1\;4\;3\;2)\}$
            \end{itemize}
        \end{red}
    \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Suppose $\sigma \in S_n$, and that $|\sigma| = k$. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Explain why $\sigma^k$ is an even permutation.

        \begin{red}
            Since $|\sigma| = k$, $\sigma^k = e$. The identity permutation $e$ is an even permutation, as it takes 0 transpositions to write. Therefore, $\sigma^k$ is an even permutation.
        \end{red}
        \item Suppose that $\sigma$ is an odd permutation. Is $k$ even or odd? How do you know?

        \begin{red}
            Let $t$ be the number of transpositions it takes to write $\sigma$. Since $\sigma$ is an odd permutation, we know that $t$ is odd.

            Now consider $\sigma^k = \underbrace{\sigma \cdot \sigma \cdot \ldots \cdot \sigma}_{k \text{ times}}$. How many total transpositions is that? Since each copy of $\sigma$ represents $t$ transpositions, $\sigma^k$ represents $t\cdot k$ total transpositions. 

            But $\sigma^k = e$ is an even transposition, so $t\cdot k$ must be even. Therefore, since $t$ is odd, $k$ must be even.
        \end{red}
        \item Conclude that a cycle of odd length is an even permutation. Feel moderate annoyance.

        \begin{red}
            Let's remind ourselves what a ``cycle of odd length'' looks like. Here is a cycle of length 3: $(1\;3\;2)$. What is the order of this beast? Certainly it has order 3. Indeed, a general fact we learned earlier is that a cycle of length $k$ must have order $k$.

            So say $\sigma$ is a cycle of odd length. Therefore its order must also be odd -- in the language we've been using, where $|\sigma| = k$, we have that $k$ is odd.

            By the previous bullet, if $\sigma$ is an odd permutation, then its order $k$ must be even. How shall we reach the conclusion of this bullet? Ah ha, with the contrapositive: if $k$ is not odd, then $\sigma$ is not an odd permutation. Or, reworded slightly: if $k$ is even, then $\sigma$ is an even permutation.

            We have reached our conclusion: a cycle of odd length (and therefore odd order) must be an even permutation.
        \end{red}
    \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Play a bit more with Cayley's theorem:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Extract from the Cayley diagram of $C_4\times C_2 = \< \Alert{r}, \Balert{b} \>$ the two permutations that describe its arrows, and therefore describe $C_4 \times C_2$ as a subgroup of a symmetric group.
        \item Do the same for $Q_8 = \< \Alert{i}, \Balert{j}, \Galert{-1} \>$.

\subsection*{Stuff about direct products}

\begin{problem}
    I want to make the relationship between the inflate-the-Cayley-diagram description and the ordered-pairs description of a direct product a bit more evident. Say that $\Alert{C_4} = \<\Alert{r} \mid \Alert{r}^4 = 1\>$ and $\Balert{C_3} = \< \Balert{b} \mid \Balert{b}^3 = 1\>$. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Write out all 12 elements of $\Alert{C_4}\times \Balert{C_3}$ as ordered pairs. (They will all look like $(\Alert{r}^k, \Balert{b}^j)$.)
        \item Use the inflation procedure to draw the Cayley diagram of $\Alert{C_4}\times \Balert{C_3}$.
        \item Label each node in your Cayley diagram with the corresponding ordered pair.
        \item (Bonus problem: Is $\Alert{C_4}\times \Balert{C_3}$ ``secretly cyclic''?)
    \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Explore $\Alert{C_2} \times \Balert{C_2} \times \Galert{C_2}$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Figure out how to repeat the inflation process to draw a Cayley diagram.
        \item Compute the orbits of each of the 8 elements and draw a cycle graph.
        \item Is this a new group? Groups of order 8 we already know are $C_8$, $C_4 \times C_2$, $D_4$, and $Q_8$. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Prove using algebra that $A\times B$ is abelian \Alert{if and only if} both $A$ and $B$ are abelian.

    \textit{Hint:} Remember that an \Alert{``if and only if''} statement is actually looking for \textit{two} proofs. I will provide you with the proof frames for each one:
    \begin{multicols}{2}
        ($\Rightarrow$) Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are both abelian.

        \ldots

        Therefore, $A\times B$ is abelian.

        ($\Leftarrow$) Suppose that $A\times B$ is abelian.

        \ldots

        Therefore, $A$ and $B$ are both abelian.
    \end{multicols}

    Remember that filling in the second line and the second-to-last line, usually by unpacking a definition (here: what does ``abelian'' mean again?), is a good way to proceed after writing the proof frame.
    
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Here we'll explore when the product of cyclic groups is ``secretly cyclic''.
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Say you have a generic group $G$ such that $|G| = n$. Suppose further that you found an element $g\in G$ such that $|g| = n$. Prove that $G$ is cyclic. (Hint: look at the orbit of $g$, and think about the definition of $|g|$.)

        \item Suppose that $a, b \in \Z$ are relatively prime. (Google it if you don't remember what this means.) Fact: $\lcm(a, b) = ab.$ Optional challenge: prove it.

        \item Consider the direct product $\Z_a \times \Z_b$, with $a$ and $b$ relatively prime. What is $|(1,1)|$?

        (\textbf{\Alert{NOTE TYPO FIX:}} I had previously written $C_a \times C_b$, in which the element $(1,1)$ would represent the identity. I could also have said, suppose that $C_a = \<g\>$ and $C_b = \<h\>$ and then think about the element $(g, h)\in C_a \times C_b$, but I think it's cleaner this way.)

        \item Conclude that $\Z_a \times \Z_b \cong \Z_{ab}.$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\end{document}
