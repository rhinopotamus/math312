\section{What do isomorphisms do?}

I keep saying that \Alert{isomorphisms respect algebraic structure}. This is a hugely-encompassing idea and I want to unpack what I mean and what some of the consequences are.

\subsection*{What is an isomorphism?}

An isomorphism is a homomorphism that is also a bijection.

\subsection*{Okay, smartass, what is a homomorphism?}

Suppose that $(G, \star)$ and $(H, \odot)$ are two groups. Then $\phi:G \to H$ is a homomorphism if \[\phi(g_1 \star g_2) = \phi(g_1) \odot \phi(g_2).\] 

\begin{exercise}
    Circle three different things in that equation that are elements of $H$.
\end{exercise}

Morally what this means is that \Alert{a homomorphism is a function that respects the groups' operations.} Another good maxim here is that \Galert{a homomorphism sends products to products.} 

As a consequence of respecting the groups' \Alert{operations}, a homomorphism respects the groups' \Alert{algebraic structures}. Specifically:

\begin{exercise} Prove each of the following statements:
    \newcommand\hitem{\item A homomorphism sends }
    \begin{itemize}
        \hitem the identity to the identity. 
        \begin{proof} 
            Say that $e_G$ is the identity in $G$ and $e_H$ is the identity in $H$. Consider $\phi(e_G \star g)$. On the one hand, since $e_G\star g = g$, $\phi(e_G \star g) = \phi(g)$. On the other hand, using the homomorphism property, $\phi(e_G \star g) = \phi(e_G) \odot \phi(g)$. Therefore, \[\phi(g) = \phi(e_G)\odot \phi(g).\]
            Well, $\phi(g)$ is some element of $H$, so it has an inverse. Let's $H$-multiply both sides of this equation by the inverse on the right:
            \begin{align*}
                \phi(g)\odot [\phi(g)]\inv &= \phi(e_G) \odot \phi(g) \odot [\phi(g)]\inv \\
                e_H &= \phi(e_G) \odot \left(\phi(g) \odot [\phi(g)]\inv\right) \\
                e_H &= \phi(e_G) \odot e_H \\
                e_H &= \phi(e_G).
            \end{align*}So: $\phi$ sends $e_G$ to $e_H$.
        \end{proof}
        \hitem inverses to inverses.
        \hitem $G$ to a subgroup of $H$. (Vocabulary: the \Alert{image} of $G$ under $\phi$ is the set $\im(\phi) = \left\{\phi(g)\mid g\in G\right\}.$ Certainly this is a sub\textit{set} of $H$, but is it a sub\textit{group} of $H$?)
        \hitem powers to powers.
        \hitem orbits to orbits.
        \hitem conjugates to conjugates.
        \hitem conjugacy classes to conjugacy classes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

Here are some examples of homomorphisms.

\begin{exercise} Prove that each of these ``sends products to products'':
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Squish everything in $G$ down to the identity in $H$. (This is a rude homomorphism.)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ponder: How does this map send orbits to orbits?
        \end{itemize}
        \item Do nothing. (Define the ``identity map'' $\id:G\to G$ as $\id(g) = g$.)
        \item If $G \leq H$, define the ``inclusion map'' $\iota:G\to H$ as $\iota(g) = g$.
        \item Define the ``exponential map'' $\exp:(\R, +) \to (\R^+, *)$ by $\exp(x) = e^x$.
        \item $\ln:(\R^+, *) \to (\R, +)$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This is, like, the best explanation for why the properties of logs are like that.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Here is an interesting \textbf{non}-example: Let $s:D_n \to D_n$ be the ``squaring map'' $s(x) = x^2$. (Hint: Remember that $D_n$ isn't abelian and compare $s(fr)$ to $s(f) s(r)$.)
        \item If $G$ is an \textbf{abelian} group, then the squaring map $s:G\to G$ is indeed a homomorphism.
        \item Define $\phi:Q_8 \to V_4$ as follows: $\phi(\pm 1) = 1, \quad \phi(\pm i) = a, \quad \phi(\pm j) = b, \quad \phi(\pm k) = ab.$
        \item Define the ``projection map'' $\pi_A:A\times B \to A$ as $\pi_A(a,b) = a$. (Similar for $\pi_B$.)
    \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\subsection*{What about isomorphisms?}

Okay, so to return to the top of this document, an isomorphism is a homomorphism that is also a bijection. 

\begin{question}
    Which of the example homomorphisms in the previous section are isomorphisms?
\end{question}

A general theme in math is that if you make something more special, you get stronger results. By adding ``bijection'' to ``homomorphism,'' you can thus expect to preserve even more structure.

\begin{exercise} Let $\phi:G\to H$ be an isomorphism. Prove that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $|\phi(g)| = |g|$. (``$\phi$ preserves orders.'')
        \begin{proof}
            Say that $|g| = n$ -- that is, $g^n = e$, but for any $k < n$, $g^k \neq e$. We need to show those two things are also true for $\phi(g)$. The first part is easy: since $\phi$ is a homomorphism, it sends powers to powers and the identity to the identity, so $\phi(g)^n = \phi(g^n) = \phi(e) = e$.

            For the second part, consider the orbit of $g$, $\<g\> = \{g, g^2, \ldots, g^{n-1}, g^n = e\}$. All these powers of $g$ are distinct. (Why?) So, since $\phi$ is a bijection (and in particular is 1-1), all their images $\{\phi(g), \phi(g^2), \ldots, \phi(g^{n-1}), \phi(g^n) = e\}$ are distinct. But since $\phi$ sends powers to powers, that list of distinct elements is $\{\phi(g), \phi(g)^2, \ldots \phi(g)^{n-1}, e\}$. Therefore, $\phi(g)^k\neq e$ for any $k < n$ -- $e$ is in that list of distinct elements at the end, so nobody else gets to be $e$.
        \end{proof}
        \item Corollary: $\phi$ sends orbits to orbits \textit{of the same size.}
        \item $\phi$ sends conjugacy classes to conjugacy classes \textit{of the same size.}
        \item $\phi$ sends subgroups to subgroups \textit{of the same size.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

If there is an isomorphism $\phi:G \to H$, we say that $G$ and $H$ are \Alert{isomorphic} and write $G\cong H$. Since an isomorphism $\phi$ preserves \textit{so much} algebraic structure, this is why it's our formal version of the idea that $G$ and $H$ are ``basically the same'' but maybe just got relabeled or re-presented.

\begin{exercise} Suppose that $G\cong H$. Prove that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $G$ is abelian if and only if $H$ is abelian.
        \item $|G| = |H|$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\subsection*{Automorphisms}
Certainly every group is isomorphic to itself. There's an obvious way to do this, but there may be more interesting ways as well. These are called \Alert{automorphisms}.

\begin{definition}
    An \Alert{automorphism} is a map $\phi:G\to G$ that is an isomorphism, ie., a bijective homomorphism.
\end{definition}

\begin{example} Prove that each of these are automorphisms.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The identity homomorphism is an automorphism.
        \item The complex-conjugate map $\overline{\phantom{z}}:\C \to \C$ given by $\overline{a+bi} = a - bi$ is an automorphism.
        \begin{proof}
            We need to check three things:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item First, that $\overline{\phantom{z}}$ is a homomorphism: $\overline{(a+bi)(c+di)} = \overline{a+bi} \cdot \overline{c+di}$. Do some tedious complex-numbers multiplication to check that the thing on the left is indeed the same as the thing on the right. (They both end up being $(ac-bd)-(ad-bc)i$.)
                \item Second, that $\overline{\phantom{z}}$ is injective (aka 1-1): Suppose that $\overline{a+bi} = \overline{c+di}$. Well, then $a-bi$ = $c-di$. Equating real and imaginary parts, we see that $a=c$ and $-b = -d$. Okay, so $b=d$. Therefore $a+bi = c+di$.
                \item Lastly, that $\overline{\phantom{z}}$ is surjective (aka onto): Pick a generic complex number $a+bi$. Well, that's $\overline{a-bi}$, so yay.
            \end{itemize}
            (Aside: these properties are just as easy to check, and maybe even easier, if you write your complex numbers in polar form $re^{i\theta}$.)
        \end{proof}
        \item We shall allow ourselves a moment of brief annoyance that the word ``conjugate'' means something different in different contexts, and now that we've gotten that out of our system: Pick a fixed element $g\in G$. The ``$g$-conjugation map'' $\phi_g:G\to G$ given by $\phi_g(h) = ghg\inv$ is an automorphism.
        \item Let's say that $G$ is an abelian group, so the squaring map $s(g) = g^2$ (which I might also write as $g\mapsto g^2$) is a homomorphism. Is it an automorphism? Prove that it is, or give an example where it's not.
        \item Is the squaring map an automorphism of $C_2$? $C_3$? $C_4$?
        \item The $k$-power map $g\mapsto g^k$ is an automorphism of $C_n$ \Alert{iff} $n$ and $k$ are relatively prime.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}
