# Mathematical typesetting systems

All of your homework in this class is required to be typeset in a mathematical typesetting program. Here are some resources for getting started.

## LaTeX

By far the easiest way to get started using LaTeX is [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com). 

You can also create a local installation on your own computer. I use [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) as my rendering engine.

I write my code in Visual Studio Code using the [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension.

Other IDEs that people like include Sublime Text, Atom, and Notepad++. I don't know much about these, so if you use one and like it, feel free to edit here.

## Typst

A relatively new LaTeX alternative is called [Typst](https://typst.app/) -- it's built to have simpler syntax and behave more like Markdown.

My side project this semester is to learn Typst -- I'm using vscode with the [Tinymist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extension. I'll post source code as I go.

## LyX

A lot of people like to use [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/) as a WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") frontend for LaTeX. I've never used it personally, but if this sounds fun, feel free!
